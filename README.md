# 🚀 RecruitLens  
### GitHub Recruiter Signal Engine

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://recruit-lens.vercel.app/

RecruitLens analyzes GitHub portfolios the way recruiters actually evaluate them — using multi-dimensional signal scoring, README intelligence, and hiring simulation modes.

It transforms a GitHub profile into structured, recruiter-ready insights.

## 🔍 Problem

Recruiters don’t read every line of code.

They scan for signals:
- Project depth  
- Documentation quality  
- Engineering maturity  
- Consistency  
- Ownership  
- Impact  

Most developers don’t know how their GitHub appears from a hiring perspective.

RecruitLens makes those signals visible and actionable.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🧮 1. 9-Dimension Signal Scoring Engine

Weighted scoring across:

- Profile Completeness  
- Repository Quality  
- Commit Consistency  
- Documentation Quality  
- Community Engagement  
- Project Diversity  
- Ownership & Depth  
- Engineering Maturity  
- Impact Score  

Each dimension contributes transparently to a final Recruiter Signal Score.

---

### 📄 2. README Quality Analyzer

Fetches README files from top repositories via the GitHub API and evaluates:

- Installation instructions  
- Usage examples  
- Architecture documentation  
- Screenshots / visuals  
- Badges  
- Demo links  
- Contributing guidelines  
- License presence  

Each README is scored (0–100) with missing elements clearly identified.

---

### 🏢 3. Recruiter Simulation Mode

Simulates different hiring environments:

- **Startup Mode** – Shipping speed, ownership, deployments  
- **Enterprise Mode** – Testing, documentation, licensing, PR structure  
- **AI/ML Mode** – Python repos, ML keywords, research signals  

Each mode highlights strengths, concerns, and hiring readiness.

---

### 🎯 4. Career Path Alignment

Evaluates readiness for:

- Frontend Engineer  
- Backend Engineer  
- Full-Stack Engineer  
- DevOps Engineer  
- ML Engineer  

Provides a breakdown of strengths and improvement areas.
